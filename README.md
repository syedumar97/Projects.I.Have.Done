# Projects.I.Have.Done
A repository with original code of some of my projeccts ranging from University projects to home projects. I don't usually include good documentation in my code so they can be a bit harder to understand. 
## The University of Sydney
### INFO1003 - Foundations of Information Technology

I took this subject in my freshmen year as an optional unit of study as I always wanted to know how websites are made (*unlike by using web apps like wix.com or wordpress*) and the underlying technicalities that ensue. It focused on Web development using `HTMl`,`CSS`, `JavaScript` and also looked at data management systems along with data forcasting using *Excel*. It was a great learning experience overall.        

__The Project__  
Make a website that is used to educate people on their happiness through an index/philosophy called [__*Gross National Happiness*__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_National_Happiness), a term coined by the old King of Bhutan [Jigme Singye Wangchuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jigme_Singye_Wangchuck), to measure the collective happiness in any specific nation. This was a *Group Project* with my team-mates' information being in the [`contact.html`](https://github.com/syedumar97/Projects.I.Have.Done/blob/master/contact.html) file. A lot of the code was done by me including the visualization of the site and the content that needs to be put on.  

__Languages Used__  

 * HTML
 * CSS
 * JavaScript
 * PHP
 * jQuery (a JavaScript Library) 
 * PostgreSQL (for the database)
 
__Salient Features__

 * A jQuery-driven World map indicating Happiness index of countries. *(Using a data map with [D3.js](https://d3js.org/))*
 * A happiness quiz.
 * User accounts.
 * AJAX.
 * Server-side database (Using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin).  
 ***Note:*** The server was provided by Faculty of Engineering and IT, The University of Sydney. Also, parts of the project are incomplete(especially color coding the map).  
  
### INFO1103 - Introduction to Programming  

Took the subject in my freshmen year too. It introduces programming using `Java` and also discusses OOPS concepts.  

__Languages used__  
  * Java  
  
__Projects__  

 - ***[CoffeeBot](https://github.com/syedumar97/Projects.I.Have.Done/blob/master/CoffeeBot.java):*** Customers can interact with the bot, order coffee and select the number of coffee shots in each cup. The system will provide an order summary and confirm the order with the customer. Payment will be processed using only valid coin and note denominations, with change being refunded in an optimal way that uses the least amount of coins and notes required.  
 - ***[MazeDoku](https://github.com/syedumar97/Projects.I.Have.Done/blob/master/MazeGame.java):*** You will have a maze board and a player moving around the board.
The player can step left, right, up or down.
However, you need to complete the maze within a given number of steps.
As in any maze, there are walls that you cannot move through.
If you try to move through a wall, you lose a life.
There is also gold on the board that you can collect if you move ontop of it.
The game can end in one of the following ways:
    * The player has completed the maze. That is, they have reached the destination.  
    * The player has no lives.  
    * The player has no remaining steps.  
  *Note:* Need to use files [`easy_board.java`](https://github.com/syedumar97/Projects.I.Have.Done/blob/master/easy_board.txt) and/or [`DEFAULT.txt`](https://github.com/syedumar97/Projects.I.Have.Done/blob/master/DEFAULT.txt) present in this repository.  

 - ***[Firebot](https://github.com/syedumar97/Projects.I.Have.Done/blob/master/Firebot.java):*** Rural firefighters continually backburn bushland in a controlled manner to reduce the risk of hazardous bushfires. In this assignment you will implement a simulation of a controlled burn within a region of land. Trees of varying heights are scattered throughout the region and fires are started at particular locations. The simulation operates on a daily time schedule where the fire spreads to neighbouring trees as each day passes according to the wind direction.  
 *Note:* Contains class files [`Simulation.java`](https://github.com/syedumar97/Projects.I.Have.Done/blob/master/Simulation.java), [`Tree.java`](https://github.com/syedumar97/Projects.I.Have.Done/blob/master/Tree.java) and [`Perlin.java`](https://github.com/syedumar97/Projects.I.Have.Done/blob/master/Perlin.java)(This file was provided by the School of IT and is not my work).
